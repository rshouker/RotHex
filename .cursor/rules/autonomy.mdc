- Do only what I explicitly asked.
- If you believe additional work is needed (refactor, extra files, docs, cleanup, follow-up fixes), do not do it automatically.
- Instead: briefly list the suggested additional actions and ask which (if any) I want.
- If the request is ambiguous, ask a clarifying question before making changes.
