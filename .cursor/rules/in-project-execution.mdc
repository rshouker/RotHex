# In-Project Execution Only

- Do not process project code or assets outside the project workflow unless instructed otherwise.
- Prefer implementation inside project source code (for this repo, `public/src`).
- For command execution, prefer npm scripts and commands run from `public/`.
- If an external one-off script/tool would be useful, do not use it by default; only use it when explicitly instructed otherwise.
